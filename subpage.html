											<h2>Camp Fire Caused Great Loss to the Green Land Cover in Paradise</h2>
										</header>
										<p>After the most destructive wildfire swept Paradise, California in 2018, the natural landscape was devasted within a week. Using the normalized difference vegetation index(NDVI) as a measure of green land cover, the picture on the right shows the area(marked in yellow and orange) that reduced sharply in the index after the fire.</p>

								        </header>
								        <p>What came along with the strong wind began in the early November 2018 in Northern California were the most destructive wildfires included the Woolsey Fire and the Camp Fire, which killed at least 85 people, destroyed more than 18,000 structures. Paradise, a town located right next to the Camp fire, was engulfed in one day. "A whole town was wiped off the face of the Earth in a matter of eight hours," resident Cole Wyatt said.</br>The fire burned for more than two weeks from the early morning on November 8. The animated gif graph below shows the whole process using the remote sensing image. The graph emphasizes the land surface temperature to better illustrate the location of the fire. </p>

									        <h2>Loss of Green Land Cover</h2>
								        </header>
								        <p>By the end of the fire on November 25, 50 lives were lost, over 95 percent of the buildings in Paradise were destroyed, and the total burn area reached about 154,000 acres. What used to be lush woods were burned to scorched lands. This dramatic change in the green land cover could be traced using remote sensing images and NDVI. The picture below on the upper left shows the NDVI of paradize area before the fire, and the picture on the upper right shows the after, where there is an obvious darker area showing the trace of Camp Fire. </br>The last picture shows the NDVI change before and after the fire. Area shown in yellow shows the medium burned places with a change lower than 0.6, while the orange area shows the highly burned places with a change no less than 0.6. From the map, the whole town was almost covered in the yellow and orange area, indicating the great loss of the green land.</p>
